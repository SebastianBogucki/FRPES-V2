# FRPES-V2
Flight Recorder and Parachute Ejection System V2 is second version of FRPES flight computer designed to fly onboard Sokół-X1 rocket.  
It's a second version of FRPES that fixed most of the problems with previous computer and added extra features like radio communication.  
This computer was also created for learning purposes and to get experience required to make more advanced flight computers in future like planned FRPES V3.
